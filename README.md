A repo exemplifying **MLOps best practices**: modularity, reproducibility, automation, and experiment tracking.

This project implements a standardized workflow for training neural networks on medical data (PCAM/TCGA). 

The idea is that you fill in the repository with the necessary functions so you can execute the ```train.py``` function. Please also fill in this ```README.md``` clearly to setup, install and run your code. 

Don't forget to setup CI and linting!
